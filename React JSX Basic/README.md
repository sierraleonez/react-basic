# Learning React Basic and JSX

## What I learned from here?
### I learned about what is React in depth
  From here I know that React is just a library that transforming our JS code into another form (in this context, HTML using React DOM) and managing the DOM manipulation (React DOM) for us, React doing this by creating some *plan* with thing called ***virtual DOM***, before mutating the real *DOM*.
### I learned about how to use standalone React in practice
  In the 4th chapter we learned about how React is working by doing practical experiments, we create an HTML file, add React and ReactDOM via CDN (also babel if you want to use JSX), now setting up bare React project from scratch seems make sense to me
